# SprayFoam TV Documentation Hub

Welcome to the knowledge base for the SprayFoam TV web application. This `/docs` directory centralises every resource an AI or human contributor needs to understand the current state of the project, its technical foundations, and the roadmap ahead.

- **Start with [`project-overview.md`](./project-overview.md)** for the mission, audience, and feature summary.
- **Review [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md)** to understand the file structure, technology stack, and component relationships.
- **Follow [`development-guide.md`](./development-guide.md)** for environment setup, common commands, and collaboration conventions.
- **Consult [`ui-component-catalog.md`](./ui-component-catalog.md)** for implementation details of each reusable component.
- **Track plans in [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md)** and current execution status in [`progress-tracker.md`](./progress-tracker.md).

## Keeping documentation current

- Update the relevant document whenever you change or add a feature.
- Log progress in [`progress-tracker.md`](./progress-tracker.md) at the end of each significant change. This file contains a changelog-friendly table plus tips for future updates.
- When planning work, synchronise tasks between [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) and the tracker so that other contributors immediately know priorities and remaining effort.

Maintaining this folder ensures that any future AI agent can quickly pick up context, plan the next steps, and keep the project moving forward.
